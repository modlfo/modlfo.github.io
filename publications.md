### My PhD Thesis

In my thesis I combined three things that I like: mathematical modeling, optimization and electronics. Basically, what I did was to develop methods for designing power systems using evolutionary algorithms. You can read my full thesis here: [Design and Optimization of Power Delivery and Distribution Systems Using Evolutionary Computation Techniques]({{ site.url }}/assets/thesis/thesis.html).

### Papers

These are a few links to some of my favorite papers published in IEEE:

* [Platform for fast evaluation and optimization of power systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5562418)
* [Fast architecture generation and evaluation techniques for the design of large power systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5618340)
* [Power conversion modeling methodology based on building block models](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5316311)
* [Generalized methodology for the analysis and design of multiphase converters with integrated magnetics](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4592347)

You can find the remaining papers searching by author "L. Laguna" in IEEExplore.

### Miscellaneous

This is a blog we published about the ModelPlug library. [Using Arduinos as SystemModeler Components](http://blog.wolfram.com/2014/11/07/using-arduinos-as-systemmodeler-components/).
