I'm was born in Mexico in the state of [Guanajuato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato). I got my first degree there, and later I moved to Spain to continue my studies.

Currently live in Sweden where I work at [Wolfram](http://wolfram.com/). I develop the simulation core of [SystemModeler](http://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler).

In my free time I produce [music](http://modlfo.github.io/music.html) and make [software and hardware](http://modlfo.github.io/projects.html) related to sound synthesis.
