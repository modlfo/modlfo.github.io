The MicroBruto is a digital synthesizer with controllers inspired by the MicroBrute.

I tried to imitate the functions of the oscillator, the envelope, filter, LFO and most important: the modulation matrix.

I have been watching demos and reviews of the Arturia MicroBrute and it seems like a very interesting synthesizer. It’s analog, cheap and flexible. But before even thinking about getting one, I wanted to “experience” the user interface. That’s why I decided to make the MicroBruto. ‘Bruto’ in Spanish can be translated as gross or stupid, but I have to clarify that the name does not reflects my option about the synthesizer. I just thought it was funny.

The MicroBruto is not an emulation, is just a digital synthesizer with controllers inspired by the MicroBrute. I tried to imitate the functions of the oscillator, the envelope, filter, LFO and most important: the modulation matrix.

Here you can see a screenshot:

The beauty of this synthesizer is that is does not need a manual. That’s why it is a Simplesizer.
