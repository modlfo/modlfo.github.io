This is program inspired by the app SoundPrism. It does no have all the features of SoundPrism but it allows you hack the code and personalize it.

Soundprism is a software midi controller that simplifies playing chords. I tried it and in a few minutes I was making nice songs. The best part is that, using the iPad, you have the multitouch screen and it feels really natural playing that thing.

I decided making my own basic version using [Processing](https://processing.org).

My version is very basic and does not include any of the nice features available in the Pro version of SoundPrism. This is a screen shot:
