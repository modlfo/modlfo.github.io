This is a very simple module that I made to protect other signal generators just in case I make a mistake. A simple active buffer with a few operational amplifiers.

This is the most basic circuit that you can make with operational amplifiers, but repeated several times.

A PDF version of the schematic can be downloaded here [Schematic](/images/vult-analog-active-buffer-schematic.pdf).

Even when the circuit is simple, it took me about 3 hours to wire it and make the panel.
