Last november I attended to the OpenFest 2016 in Bulgaria where I presented an overview of Vult.

OpenFest is the biggest conference in Bulgaria focused on open technologies. The conference is held in Sofia. This is the second time I attend but the first time presenting there.

In addition to the demos that I showed there. I also prepared a version of the closing song where I explain with more detail what happens in the screen.
